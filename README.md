# 💻 CodeConnect Frontend – React + Tailwind CSS

Welcome to the **frontend** of CodeConnect – a platform where developers connect, team up, and build amazing things together.

This frontend is built with **React.js**, **Tailwind CSS**, and **Axios**. It communicates with the backend (Express.js API) using secure routes, filters dev profiles, and manages auth states via JWT.
